## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Harness.Worktree` — per-run git worktree lifecycle: `create/2` carves an
  isolated working directory and `harness/<id>` branch out of a target repo so
  concurrent runs never collide; `commit/2` captures the agent's work as a
  commit on that branch; `finish/3` makes the keep-or-teardown decision
  (tear down on success, retain on failure for inspection — configurable);
  `remove/1` is the unconditional teardown. Teardown removes only the working
  directory — the branch and its commits are the run's deliverable.
- `Harness.Worktree.Sweeper` — boot-time orphan reaper. A run that crashes
  before `finish/3` leaves its worktree behind; the sweeper runs once at
  application start, self-discovers parent repos from leftover worktrees, and
  reaps every orphan that is not a deliberately-retained failure.
- Worktree root is configurable via `:harness, :worktree` (`base_dir`,
  `retain_on_failure`, `sweep_on_boot`) and the `HARNESS_WORKTREE_ROOT` env var.
- `Harness.Roadmap` — ingests a task from an rmap roadmap (by id or the next
  pending one) and renders it as a ready-to-run agent prompt. Shells out to the
  `rmap` CLI (`show` / `next` / `delegate`) rather than parsing the roadmap
  itself, keeping rmap the single source of truth. The input half of the loop.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter` behaviour — the contract every headless coding-agent
  adapter implements: a capability declaration, headless-command construction,
  raw-output capture with termination detection, and cancellation. Raw
  passthrough only — no normalized event model. Agents are spawned over an OTP
  port through a `/bin/sh` wrapper that hands them a stdin already at EOF, so a
  headless CLI never stalls peeking for piped input.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.Claude` — the first concrete adapter: drives Claude Code
  headlessly (`claude -p`, raw `stream-json` output, `--permission-mode
  bypassPermissions` for unattended runs, `--continue` session resume against
  the per-job worktree).
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.Codex` — the second concrete adapter, and the first
  proof the `AgentAdapter` contract is not Claude-shaped: drives Codex
  headlessly (`codex exec` raw `--json` JSONL,
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for unattended runs,
  `exec resume --last` session resume against the per-job worktree). Codex's
  invocation is structurally unlike Claude's — `exec` is a subcommand and
  resuming swaps in `exec resume` rather than adding a flag — yet it was built
  against the unchanged behaviour and passes the conformance suite unchanged,
  so no abstraction leak was surfaced.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.Cursor` — the Cursor adapter: drives `cursor-agent -p`
  headlessly (raw `stream-json` output, `--force --trust` for unattended runs on
  a fresh worktree, `--continue` session resume). Passes the conformance suite
  unchanged — the contract held against a third agent with no behaviour leak.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.Grok` — the Grok Build adapter: drives Grok headlessly
  (`grok -p`, raw `streaming-json` output, `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`
  for unattended runs, `--continue` session resume against the per-job
  worktree). Grok's headless-only extras (`--best-of-n`, `--check`, worktree
  flags) are deferred to the capability registry, not the core behaviour.
  Passes the conformance suite unchanged.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.Antigravity` — the Antigravity CLI adapter: drives `agy`
  headlessly (`agy -p`, raw output captured verbatim,
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for unattended runs, `--continue` session
  resume). Passes the conformance suite unchanged.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.Driver` — the generic run driver: spawns any adapter,
  captures raw output, and enforces two timeout guards — a total-run budget and
  an idle window reset on every output chunk — so a runaway or wedged run is
  killed. Termination is derived from the process closing or a deadline, never
  the exit code. Returns a `Harness.AgentAdapter.Outcome`; timeouts configurable
  via `:harness, :run`. An `:on_spawn` hook hands the run handle to the caller
  the moment the agent spawns, so a wrapping process can cancel it mid-run.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.OSProcess` — shared port / OS-process lifecycle helper
  (os-pid lookup, idempotent close, mailbox drain, kill) every adapter reuses.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.ConformanceCase` — the reusable conformance suite every
  adapter must pass, parameterized by adapter module: it pins the contract for
  invocation, verbatim raw-output capture, termination detection, timeout, and
  adapter-level cancellation. The contract checks are agent-free (synthesized
  port messages, a `/bin/sleep` stand-in); one `:integration`-tagged test drives
  the real agent end to end. The gate Codex and every later adapter (Cursor,
  Grok, Antigravity) are held to — a leak it catches is fixed in the behaviour,
  never patched around in the adapter. Run against every adapter — Claude,
  Codex, Cursor, Grok, Antigravity — and `Harness.FakeAdapter`.
- `Harness.Verification` — the run grader: runs a target project's check stack
  against a worktree and aggregates the results into a `Verdict`. This is how
  harness decides "did the job succeed?" objectively, never from the agent's
  self-reported exit code. Ships an Elixir preset (`mix test.json`,
  `mix dialyzer.json`, credo, doctor, sobelow); the stack is configurable via
  `:harness, :verification`. Each check is spawned over an OTP port with a
  per-check timeout, so a hung check is killed rather than wedging the run. The
  verification half of the loop.
- `Harness.Run` — the supervised run lifecycle: a `:gen_statem` that owns one
  job end to end, moving through `dispatched → running → committing → verifying
  → {done | failed}`. It carves the isolated worktree, dispatches the agent,
  waits for termination, commits the agent's work to the run branch, runs the
  verification stack, and settles on a verdict — the single-agent core loop
  working end to end. A run that produced no diff settles `:no_changes`. Each
  step runs in a monitored task so a crashing step never crashes the run; a
  per-run lifetime budget and `cancel/1` both abort cleanly, SIGKILLing the
  agent; `status/1` exposes live state. A run is graded by the verification
  stack alone, never by the agent's exit code — a run whose agent timed out is
  still verified.
- `Harness.Run.Supervisor` — the `:one_for_one` `DynamicSupervisor` each
  `Harness.Run` starts under as a `:temporary` child, so one run crashing is
  isolated from its siblings and a failed run is never restarted. `start_run/4`
  is the entry point; runs are looked up by id through a `Registry`.
- Autonomous repair loop — a red verification verdict is no longer terminal.
  While repair attempts remain, `Harness.Run` resumes the **same** agent with a
  prompt (`Harness.Run.RepairPrompt`) carrying the failing checks' output,
  re-commits, and re-grades. The objective check stack stays the grader, so the
  agent is repairing rather than self-grading. The loop stops on green, at the
  attempt cap, or on a non-red terminal failure of an attempt — a quota-starved
  agent that produces no diff settles `:no_changes` instead of burning the
  remaining attempts. `repair_attempts` on `Harness.Run.Result` and
  `Harness.Run.Status` reports how many attempts a run made.
- `Harness.Batch` — the batch layer: fans a set of tasks out across supervised
  `Harness.Run` children under a configurable concurrency cap, tolerates partial
  failure (one red or crashed run never aborts the batch), and collects one
  `Harness.Run.Result` per task — in input order — into a `Harness.Batch.Result`.
  A batch is typically an `rmap` bundle or `rmap next-bundle` result.
- `Harness.Run.RetryPolicy` + `Harness.Run.FailureClass` — failure-classified
  retry: a failed run is classified `:transient` (a process crash or flaky
  check — retried with capped exponential backoff), `:quota_exhausted` (a
  subscription agent at its cap — stops retrying that agent at once and marks it
  for fail-over, since the reset window is hours, not a backoff timescale), or
  `:terminal` (a genuine red verdict — never retried). The policy is available
  as a standalone helper (`RetryPolicy.run/2`) and configurable via
  `:harness, :retry_policy`; wiring it into `Harness.Batch` is pending Task 28.
- Run lifecycle timeouts and the repair-attempt cap are configurable via
  `:harness, :run` (`lifetime_timeout`, `terminal_linger`,
  `max_repair_attempts`) alongside the existing agent `total_timeout` /
  `idle_timeout`.
- Caller-controlled agent environment — `Harness.AgentAdapter.Invocation` carries
  an `env` map threaded through every adapter's `build_command/1` into the port
  spawn: `%{"KEY" => "value"}` sets a variable, `%{"KEY" => false}` scrubs an
  inherited one (e.g. removing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` so `claude` falls back to its
  subscription OAuth). Passed per run via the `:env` opt to `start_run/4`; the
  orchestrator BEAM's own environment is never mutated. The conformance suite
  gates both injection and scrubbing on every adapter.
- `Harness.AgentRules` + `priv/agent_rules/canonical.md` — the canonical,
  harness-owned rule set every dispatched agent receives. A curated filterable
  subset: verification gates (coverage thresholds, dialyzer-zero,
  credo-strict) are deliberately excluded because the verification runner
  enforces them, not prose the agent is trusted to honour.
- `Harness.AgentAdapter.RulesInjection` — per-adapter rule-set injection
  threaded through every adapter's `build_command/1`. Claude uses
  `--append-system-prompt-file`; Codex and Cursor render an ephemeral rule
  file into the run worktree; Grok and Antigravity prompt-prepend (neither
  exposes a system-prompt flag or a native rule file). Two different agents
  dispatched by harness now receive the same canonical rules without any
  hand-maintained per-repo file.
- `Harness.AgentRegistry` — declarative per-adapter capability listing plus
  availability state. `Harness.Batch` and `Harness.Run.Supervisor` gain a
  capability check before dispatch: a run requesting an unsupported
  capability is rejected up front, never mid-run. A quota-exhausted agent is
  marked unavailable and the batch routes its task to another capable
  adapter with headroom; fail-over routing is observable via
  `Harness.Batch.Result` events.
- Initial OTP application scaffold with a supervision tree (`Harness.Application`).
- Standard Elixir dev/test tooling stack: Styler (formatter plugin), Credo,
  Dialyxir, Doctor, Sobelow, `ex_unit_json`, `dialyzer_json`, `ex_dna`, `ex_ast`,
  and Reach + Boxart for OTP analysis.
- `descripex` as the agent-facing API dependency.
- `tidewave` + `bandit` for the dev MCP/HTTP surface (Tidewave on port 4016).
- `cli/0` preferred-env wiring for `mix test.json` / `mix dialyzer.json`.
- Dialyzer configured with `plt_add_deps: :apps_direct`; PLTs under `priv/plts/`.
- Project configs: `.doctor.exs`, `.dialyzer_ignore.exs`, `.reach.exs`, `.mcp.json`.
- Baseline `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and this changelog.
